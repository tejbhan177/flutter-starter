1
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,664
June, 1950,

2
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:03,247
the Korean war broke out on full scale.

3
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,414
On June 27th, the U.S. 7th fleet

4
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:09,914
sailed into the Taiwanese ports
of keelung and kaohsiung,

5
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:12,580
where they carried out
reconnoiter and patrol operations,

6
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:14,206
as well as military exercise.

7
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:15,955
On September 15th,

8
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:18,205
the x corps of the U.S.
army landed in inchon,

9
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,206
where they marched north
joined by the "UN. Forces".

10
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:24,247
Thousands of aircrafts of
the U.S. far east airforce

11
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,914
entered Chinese territorial space,

12
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:28,540
warfare spreading to the yalu river.

13
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,122
China's territorial sovereignty
and national security

14
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:34,040
were under severe threat.

15
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,455
In response to the
provocative action on the invaders' part,

16
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,331
as requested by the dprk,
the Chinese government,

17
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,789
after deliberate consideration,

18
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,830
decided to send troops to North Korea.

19
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,080
On October 25th,

20
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,122
the pva engaged the enemy

21
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:49,330
for the first time since
they entered North Korea,

22
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:52,206
starting the quest to
aid Korean allies against the Americans.

23
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,039
Back in the day the prc had just founded.

24
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,914
The industrial system was incomplete,

25
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,580
the air force was insubstantial

26
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,747
and ammunition was in extreme shortage.

27
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,955
The fight was a demonstration

28
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:05,289
for consolidating the new regime

29
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,580
as well as establishing
China's image on the international stage.

30
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:10,665
The stake was extremely high.

31
00:03:11,206 --> 00:03:13,164
By 1953,

32
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,747
after two periods of arduous warfare,

33
00:03:15,748 --> 00:03:18,165
the pva managed to shift
from defensive to offensive,

34
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,789
mid-July,

35
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,789
the pva launched the third-stage action

36
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,081
of summer counterstrike,
centered around the battle of kumsong

37
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,205
this will be the final combat.

38
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,664
Winning this battle

39
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:31,705
would make us the ultimate Victor

40
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:33,915
in the war against the
American invasion of North Korea.

41
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,747
A division code-named yanshan unit

42
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:41,247
was ordered to reinforce the frontline

43
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,623
by covering the main force
at right flank in the general offensive.

44
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:48,747
Should they fail to reach the
assigned location by 06:00 in the morning,

45
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:51,122
the entire corps would have to

46
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,455
dive into a pack of wolves
like a hawk with broken wings,

47
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:55,123
getting themselves in grave peril.

48
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,998
The situation couldn't be more dire.

49
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:01,414
And that was when the
rapids of kumgang river

50
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,122
stood ruthlessly

51
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:04,831
in their way.

52
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,040
Sir,

53
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,622
do you hear that?

54
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,373
Canons are being fired in kumgsong, listen.

55
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:31,080
Xiao hu,

56
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,622
you think you've grown smarter now?

57
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,998
How could you possibly know
from tens of kilometers away?

58
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,498
It's just thunder.

59
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:38,955
No way!

60
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:40,623
The fight must have started.

61
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:45,415
What took the engineer battalion so long
to fix that bridge anyway?

62
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Don't they know
tens of thousands of men are waiting?

63
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
Shut up!

64
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,831
Keep your ass on the ground.

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,080
Attention, everyone!

66
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:00,330
All units keep close!

67
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,414
Stick to the route, on the double!

68
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:04,830
No man falls behind!

69
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,415
Move!

70
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:10,039
Come on! Catch up!

71
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,581
- All of you, chop-chop!
- 3rd squad, follow me!

72
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,623
At that time,

73
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,956
I had just joined the army.

74
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:19,581
They all called me xiao hu.

75
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:22,540
American planes

76
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,373
flew over us every single day.

77
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:29,498
I wished we had some planes to protect us.

78
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,748
But we only had a few

79
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,331
and they were all at the front.

80
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:38,456
There's nothing we could do.

81
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,080
Our squad leader

82
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:44,081
was obsessed with the idea

83
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,415
of getting into action

84
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,956
and winning a medal.

85
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,415
He told me that,

86
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,498
only by winning the final combat

87
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,330
could we go home

88
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,455
and live a peaceful life.

89
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:58,747
Cross the river in turn!

90
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:00,455
But fast!

91
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:03,580
The whole division have to
cross the kumgang in an hour!

92
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:04,955
Cross the river in turn!

93
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:06,790
On the double!

94
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,622
Division.

95
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:12,122
Advance force of yanshan unit
had made contact with engineer company.

96
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,580
All troops follow in turn.

97
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,956
Request instruction whether
to cross the river immediately!

98
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:18,998
Advance company,
cross the river as planned.

99
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:23,205
All units of 301 regiment,
cross the river in turn.

100
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,289
302 and 303 regiments,

101
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,498
follow up and take cover.

102
00:07:27,623 --> 00:07:29,455
Do not expose tracks of the main force.

103
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,664
Await further instruction.

104
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,747
All operations shall be
carried out at night if necessary.

105
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:35,206
Yes, copy that.

106
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,373
At the time,

107
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,748
there's only one way

108
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:42,040
to the kumsong front,

109
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,748
a tactical military bridge.

110
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,623
Every single one of us

111
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:50,748
wanted to engage the
enemy across the river.

112
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,581
However,

113
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:56,790
that deep impetuous river

114
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:59,331
stopped us.

115
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,456
I see.

116
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,206
You didn't even get us one single shell.

117
00:08:40,665 --> 00:08:42,455
The bridge is about to be rejoined

118
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,122
and the main force should be
on the other side now.

119
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,414
Not yet.

120
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:48,580
Advance force of yanshan unit has
made contact with engineer company,

121
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,040
just arriving at the shoal.

122
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,664
A recon plane just dropped by,

123
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,456
that could mean the harbingers
Are coming, then we are done.

124
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,122
If only you had brought in some extra ammo

125
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,497
we could've shot
those flies Down,

126
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:02,997
and they'll be the ones going blind.

127
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:05,540
Then we'll dominate the night time.

128
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:07,872
That won't happen even with extra ammo.

129
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:10,247
The recon planes are too damn fast.

130
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,123
And we're not using
slingshots here, either.

131
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,081
Get cocky all they want,

132
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,206
but I can take them all out if
they would just dive a little lower.

133
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,373
We can't get the shells over here.

134
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,706
There's nothing the lieutenant can do.

135
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:29,247
Our company

136
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,748
already donated two guns to the other guys.

137
00:09:31,873 --> 00:09:33,914
Another three are being mended.

138
00:09:33,915 --> 00:09:35,747
That leaves us with just two.

139
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,623
We can't possibly give any more.

140
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,372
Then fire them together.

141
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:40,497
Lieutenant's order.

142
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,248
No firing them together.

143
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:47,914
Two guns.

144
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:49,580
Number one and number two,

145
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:51,830
the latter being a concealed emplacement.

146
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:54,456
Can't risk exposing it
unless it's absolutely necessary.

147
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,665
That's the plan.

148
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:57,914
Concealed emplacement.

149
00:09:57,915 --> 00:09:59,831
You'll be in charge of that.

150
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:01,623
And I got number one.

151
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,747
Also,

152
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:05,330
from now on,

153
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,914
I call the shots here.

154
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:09,415
Sergeant guan,

155
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:15,956
lieutenant's orders.

156
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:28,331
Sure.

157
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:30,748
I'm thinking,

158
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,998
maybe I should take the one in front

159
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:36,081
and you go to the concealed emplacement.

160
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:38,956
Second lieutenant zhang,

161
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,414
everyone, hurry up.

162
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:43,414
The bridge is about to be rejoined.

163
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:44,706
Hurry!

164
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,331
Say...

165
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,331
Hurry!

166
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,623
Follow up!

167
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,040
Take cover!

168
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,498
Take cover!

169
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:54,123
Take cover!

170
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,123
The harbingers! Get down.

171
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:25,497
Regiment, regiment,

172
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:26,748
this is the 8th company.

173
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,039
Regiment, this is the 8th company.

174
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,748
Do you copy?

175
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,330
Did you get through to the regiment?

176
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:34,748
I'm on it.

177
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,247
What about the engineer company?

178
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:37,372
I'm trying.

179
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:38,622
This is the 8th company.

180
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:39,248
Engineer company,

181
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,623
regiment, do you copy?

182
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:08,040
The bridge is gone.

183
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,997
It's a recon plane, take cover!

184
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,331
Take cover.

185
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:23,831
Engineer company. Hurry. Fix the bridge.

186
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:27,998
Five degrees to the right.

187
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:37,372
- Got him.
- It's the aa guns.

188
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:39,248
- Fantastic.
- It's our aa guns.

189
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,705
Regiment.

190
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:45,165
Regiment, this is the 8th company.

191
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,873
Sir, regiment is on.

192
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:49,748
Hello.

193
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,498
What? It's damaged?

194
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,497
How bad is it?

195
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:56,830
Four meters?

196
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:57,665
Hello?

197
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,123
Hello?

198
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,581
Lao gao.

199
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,040
Lao gao.

200
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,747
How bad is the damage?

201
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:07,123
Can our company cross first?

202
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,289
You know what?

203
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,122
Xiao hu and I will go first.

204
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,581
Find a way around.

205
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,956
Are you saying that you're smarter than me?

206
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,706
You think the bridge's gonna fix it itself?

207
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:20,830
That somehow it requires no time?

208
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:22,248
Just wait.

209
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,581
Take cover.

210
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,747
When are we going to cross
the river now that the bridge is gone?

211
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:30,248
That's right.
And we've been waiting for so long.

212
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:42,040
Qiao,

213
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,415
if you're still alive,

214
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:47,040
we'd be going to kumsong together.

215
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,456
Now,

216
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,665
I'll take you there.

217
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:55,498
Rest assured.

218
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,040
When we get to kumsong,

219
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,165
I'll win one of them medals for you boys.

220
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:05,789
Sir,

221
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,665
have some water.

222
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,873
Fuck off.

223
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,165
You keep staring at that photo.

224
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,123
Regiment.

225
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,790
Regiment.

226
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,123
Hello.

227
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:21,123
Too much inference.

228
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:23,914
That's the new operator girl regiment sent,

229
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:24,955
I heard she's from sichuan, too.

230
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:25,915
You guys must have a special bond.

231
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,539
She doesn't even know my name.

232
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,040
What special bond?

233
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,623
But I do know that

234
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:33,539
she's from wusheng county, nanchong.

235
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,165
A place called yankou.

236
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,415
We just never talked.

237
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,206
Special bond my ass.

238
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,455
Sir, examination complete.

239
00:15:58,456 --> 00:15:59,747
We can cross whenever we're ready.

240
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,289
Inform division,

241
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,955
bridge is now fixed.

242
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:04,414
Preparing to cross.

243
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,497
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,747
- Off the bridge.
- Now.

245
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,747
Clean up the bridge.

246
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:11,081
Yes, sir.

247
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,247
Rejoining complete.
We can cross in ten minutes.

248
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:18,580
Yes, sir.

249
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:19,998
Hurry!

250
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,831
Assemble!

251
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,289
Assemble!

252
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,498
Quick! 2nd unit assemble!

253
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:29,789
We need more hands here.

254
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,206
Get the pile driver moving.

255
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,040
Sir.

256
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,122
Word of command!

257
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:53,581
Kumgang river!

258
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,956
- After we crossed...
- Lieutenant gao,

259
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,623
lieutenant gao,

260
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,747
the colonel asked me
to tell you this in person

261
00:17:03,748 --> 00:17:04,914
for it's too complicated
to explain over radio.

262
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,123
Have some water first.

263
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,790
Colonel's order.

264
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,455
To make sure we arrive

265
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:11,997
at kumsong tomorrow at 0600 hours,

266
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,664
our troops must cross the river

267
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,414
before 0500 tomorrow morning.

268
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:16,415
Understood.

269
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,416
And there's been
a change of plan for your company.

270
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,790
You'll be the last to cross

271
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,248
and under the engineer company's command.

272
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,206
They'll tell you what to do and when.

273
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:30,998
But, how does it work exactly?

274
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:33,622
Once they run into any trouble

275
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:35,206
you guys are up.

276
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,081
Fix the bridge.

277
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:42,831
Lao gao.

278
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,456
Lao gao.

279
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:46,290
Fix the bridge?

280
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:55,248
I see.

281
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,373
Consider it done.

282
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:01,872
- Xin qin.
- Yes, sir.

283
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:02,873
Tell the engineer company

284
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,497
to keep us posted on the
fixing progress every 30 minutes.

285
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:06,415
Yes, sir.

286
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,373
- First squad.
- Present.

287
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:08,123
- Second squad.
- Present.

288
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:09,831
Lao gao.

289
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,747
Pack up your gears,

290
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:12,706
get ready for fixing the bridge.

291
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:13,498
Yes, sir.

292
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,789
Lao gao, why us again?

293
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,914
It was us the last time,

294
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:18,039
and this time, too.

295
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,165
Surely we're not doing this every time?

296
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:21,914
We're here to fight,

297
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:23,581
not fixing Bridges.

298
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,790
You don't think that's part of the job?

299
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,497
How are we gonna fight
when the bridge's broken?

300
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,373
Are you out of your mind?

301
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,373
You promised me

302
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:34,122
that I'll win a medal for the boys.

303
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:35,956
Everyone wants a medal.

304
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,956
I know exactly what you think.

305
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,455
It won't stop you from winning anything.

306
00:18:39,456 --> 00:18:41,416
Talk with your tongue
straightened out, would you?

307
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,164
Excuse me?

308
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,705
I'm just saying.

309
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,955
Every time you get mad
you start speaking in jiangxi dialect.

310
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:51,080
Like anyone understands that gibberish.

311
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,122
I didn't make out a word you said.

312
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:53,123
Your words don't make any sense to me too.

313
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,164
See, now you're not making any sense again.

314
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,331
I have no idea what you're talking about.

315
00:18:58,415 --> 00:18:59,915
Do you understand me?

316
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:01,623
I'm not thirsty.

317
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,665
Are you fucking kidding me?

318
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:08,497
The recon plane is back.

319
00:19:08,498 --> 00:19:09,956
Take cover, take cover.

320
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:37,248
2nd and 3rd company cross in ten minutes.

321
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,498
Get moving!

322
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,497
Recon plane!

323
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:50,622
All units, take cover immediately!

324
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,330
Engineer company, get ready to take fire!

325
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:56,456
Rear units fall back!
Advance units speed up the crossing!

326
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:00,997
Damn howitzer!

327
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,414
Everyone, fan out and take cover!

328
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,497
Howitzer!

329
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:05,290
- Fan out!
- Take cover!

330
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,080
Take cover!

331
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,498
Howitzer!

332
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,040
Medic!

333
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:26,498
Medic!

334
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:27,956
Medic!

335
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,790
Everyone down!

336
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,206
It's not over yet.

337
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:40,915
- Get down.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:51,956
Check casualties.

339
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:53,998
This is the 8th company.

340
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:55,914
Engineer company, do you copy?

341
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:57,206
This is the 8th company.

342
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:00,331
- Did you get through to engineer company?
- Not yet.

343
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:21,623
There goes the bridge again.

344
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,956
Sir, signal's completely gone now.

345
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,248
We have to go to the engineer company.

346
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,539
We'll keep you guys posted.

347
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,705
Good.

348
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:29,955
- Be safe out there.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,164
- Lao lu.
- Sir.

350
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,330
Bring two men with them.

351
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:33,331
Yes, sir.

352
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,165
- You two, follow me.
- Sir,

353
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:36,414
we need to find another high ground

354
00:21:36,415 --> 00:21:37,789
to set the radio.

355
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,455
The signal's less likely
to be scrambled up above.

356
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,164
We can send back intel
about the shoal from there.

357
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:43,497
- Got it.
- Move.

358
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:45,373
- Stay safe.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:47,956
- Liu hao.
- Sir.

360
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:50,705
Do you understand what xin oin said?

361
00:21:50,706 --> 00:21:51,830
Go higher and find signal.

362
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:52,831
Yes, sir.

363
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:54,622
- I need two operators.
- Sir.

364
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:55,705
Third squad, follow me.

365
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:56,915
Yes, sir.

366
00:21:58,248 --> 00:21:59,622
Take your torches.

367
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:01,455
- Keep an eye on the harbingers.
- What's this for?

368
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:02,747
You talk too much.

369
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:04,414
You'll be on high ground.
Send signals in time.

370
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:05,498
Yes, sir.

371
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,747
Comrades.

372
00:22:30,748 --> 00:22:31,914
This bridge

373
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,165
is our lifeline.

374
00:22:34,665 --> 00:22:37,415
Let's show the Americans

375
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,872
that this bridge

376
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,831
could not be destroyed by them.

377
00:22:43,373 --> 00:22:45,539
All other Bridges have been ruined.

378
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,705
This wooden bridge is our last hope.

379
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:49,206
Come on!

380
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,080
Move the ammo forward, quick.

381
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,873
Clock is ticking, follow me.

382
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,123
You boys, come with me.

383
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,039
Now, move the ammo forward
and put them together.

384
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,830
Lao San, you contact regiment,

385
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,205
I'll try and reach lieutenant gao.

386
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:06,331
Yes, sir.

387
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,248
Now,

388
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:09,455
take your men to the hilltop.

389
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,956
Roger. Let's go.

390
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,165
Go.

391
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,455
- Heizi, erhu, - sir.

392
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:24,205
Disperse and go in.
Stand watch for the other side.

393
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,165
Yes, sir.

394
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,206
Come on.

395
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:27,665
Go.

396
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:57,705
Third squad. Get the timber to the bridge.

397
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,372
Hilltop, is the transfer in position?

398
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:00,331
Affirmative.

399
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:01,747
What's the situation at the shoal?

400
00:24:01,748 --> 00:24:03,581
Haven't received any reports from there.

401
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,331
Something's wrong.

402
00:24:22,206 --> 00:24:25,581
"Something's wrong."

403
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:48,331
"Roger that."

404
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:49,915
Take position.

405
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:52,622
- Gunner one in position.
- Gunner three in position.

406
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:54,663
- Gunner two in position.
- Gunner four in position.

407
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:08,747
Comrade, who's your commander?

408
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:10,164
The second lieutenant.

409
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,165
Come on.

410
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:13,206
Sir.

411
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:16,205
What's this? State your department.

412
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,830
We are signalers from the 8th company.

413
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,580
What's the situation on the bridge now?

414
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,497
Estimated time of recovery, 0300 hours.

415
00:25:21,498 --> 00:25:23,455
We couldn't get any signal
so they sent me here.

416
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,039
You can set up your
station behind that tank.

417
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,290
Yes, sir.

418
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,456
Go now,

419
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:28,915
it's safer there.

420
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:30,373

425
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,664
Stay low.

00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,456
Gunners take position.

511
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:38,372
Kill the lights, get through asap.

512
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:40,040
Watch you feet.

513
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:44,665
As a matter of fact,

514
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:49,915
we had been keeping a close eye
on our boys on the other side.

515
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,540
But that's the thing about battlefields.

516
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:55,955
You don't always know

517
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,581
who they are

518
00:31:57,998 --> 00:31:59,373
or their names.

519
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,623
You just know they're on your side.

520
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:06,956
And that they got us through the bridge.

521
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:09,415
Chances are,

522
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,247
you may never see each other again.

523
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:13,206
Sir.

524
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:14,705
It's like suicide.

525
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:16,290
No one knew

526
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:18,498
what really happened there.

527
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:22,581
But in a sense we did know.

528
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:25,748
What else could it be

529
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,331
but sacrifice?

530
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,248
I'm going over there to help.

531
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:33,456
- Sir.
- You two guard here well.

532
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:40,915
They are fighting on the other side.

533
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:43,580
All units that
aren't on the bridge, take cover now.

534
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,081
Do not expose yourselves.

535
00:32:57,873 --> 00:33:00,080
Rear units stop crossing.

536
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:02,331
Advance units speed up the crossing.

537
00:33:06,373 --> 00:33:07,873
Lao gao.

538
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:10,540
Lao gao.

539
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,748
Lao gao.

540
00:33:14,081 --> 00:33:15,289
Lao gao.

541
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,372
No man falls behind, catch up.

542
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:18,206
Lao gao.

543
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:19,497
Let me cross and help them.

544
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,705
What will you do?

545
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:22,040
You can't even help yourself.

546
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:39,081
Watch out! Bombs in the water.

547
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:41,414
- Engineer company.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:42,830
Hurry, go help.

549
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:44,331
Yes, sir.

550
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,205
Go help.

551
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:47,206
Lao gao.

552
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,623
Lao gao.

553
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:49,748
Lao gao.

554
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,748
Lao gao.

555
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,415
Lao gao.

556
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:55,498
Lao gao.

557
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:57,123
Hang on there.

558
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,873
Lao gao.

559
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,165
Lao gao.

560
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:05,455
Lao gao.

561
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,956
Medic.

562
00:34:08,706 --> 00:34:11,248
Comrade operator. Hang in there.

563
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:13,790
I need a stretcher.

564
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:16,373
Someone fix the bridge.

565
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,706
Recon planes.

566
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:53,164
More hands here. Push the tank down.

567
00:34:53,165 --> 00:34:55,040
Block the breach.

568
00:34:55,248 --> 00:34:56,540
Lao gao.

569
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:05,290
Leave me.

570
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,331
Go fix the bridge.

571
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,748
Go fix the bridge.

572
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,248
Keep pushing.

573
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,789
Good swimmers of the 7th company.

574
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,248
Sir.

575
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:33,872
Everyone.

576
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:35,205
Shoulder arms.

577
00:35:35,206 --> 00:35:36,997
We're crossing the river first.

578
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:38,540
- Yes, sir.

579
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:41,164
There's undercurrent four meters under.

580
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,205
Swimming across is not an option.

581
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,747
The attack begins at six or does it not?

582
00:35:45,748 --> 00:35:48,164
You want to be
held responsible for delaying it?

583
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:49,330
Yes.

584
00:35:49,331 --> 00:35:51,539
I'm responsible for whatever goes on here.

585
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,998
And I'm going to join them now.

586
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:56,205
The only way to the other side

587
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:57,206
is through that bridge.

588
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:02,414
The harbinger is here.

589
00:36:02,415 --> 00:36:04,456
Fan out and take cover.

590
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,622
The harbinger is here.

591
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,706
Take cover now.

592
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:35,831
Take cover now!

593
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:53,915
Get down.

594
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,790
You can't stop me.

595
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,623
You just can't.

596
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:40,248
Old Smith: You know,

597
00:37:40,915 --> 00:37:44,581
lots of people are
terrified to take a flight.

598
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:49,040
There are fears in their mind,

599
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:51,665
just like what I feel now.

600
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,415
But can you imagine,

601
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:55,872
once,

602
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,998
I was a us. Air force pilot.

603
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:07,581
The first angel sounded his trumpet,

604
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:12,498
and there came hail
and fire mixed with blood,

605
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,081
and it was hurled down upon the earth.

606
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:20,331
A third of the earth was burned up.

607
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,415
And... hmm...
A third of the trees were burned up.

608
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:29,415
And all the green grass was burned up.

609
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:35,290
The second angel sounded his trumpet,

610
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:43,415
and something like a huge mountain,
all ablaze, was thrown into the sea...

611
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:45,205
Warthog,

612
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:46,955
that is some poetry.

613
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:50,040
But please confirm
the b26s have hit the target first.

614
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,748
This is no poetry but
the book of resolution, sweetheart.

615
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,248
And yeah, this is the view I see.

616
00:38:59,665 --> 00:39:02,373
It's called the book
of revelations, cowboy.

617
00:39:03,831 --> 00:39:07,456
Whatever, it is what I see.

618
00:39:10,706 --> 00:39:12,039
This is mole,

619
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,414
the bz6s were accurate
and the target has been hit.

620
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:18,498
The delayed-action bombs are in position.

621
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,039
Copy, cowboys.

622
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,206
Now please proceed damage assessment.

623
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,581
Alright.

624
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:29,581
Lower altitude.

625
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,873
Initiating damage assessment.

626
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,415
Old Smith: The sky belonged to us.

627
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:40,206
Their weapons were a joke.

628
00:39:40,998 --> 00:39:44,665
I heard the Chinese use two sticks to eat.

629
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:48,456
They don't even know
how to build a bicycle.

630
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:51,748
But it was the oddest thing

631
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:56,540
that bridge just...
Just keep getting fixed.

632
00:39:57,415 --> 00:40:01,372
And my mission seemed to never end.

633
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:03,456
See you in never.

634
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,081
Sir.

635
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,331
Why won't they just blow up?

636
00:40:28,623 --> 00:40:31,623
Atc! Atc! We are under attack.

637
00:40:40,206 --> 00:40:42,997
Warthog, warthog, what's your status?

638
00:40:42,998 --> 00:40:46,747
There's an aa gun one hundred
and fifty yards west to the target.

639
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:47,955
Can you return fire?

640
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:50,914
Negative. No ammo. Damn it!

641
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,665
Fucking chinks!

642
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,539
No chute.

643
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,164
The kid is dead.

644
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,497
Do you hear me?

645
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,123
The kid is kia.

646
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:19,747
Hey hill, I heard from
my pal in the army that

647
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:22,706
they lost forty thousand men last month?

648
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:25,165
We are lucky up here you know?

649
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:28,456
Right? Right, hill?

650
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:34,497
Hey hill, listen,
I heard my cousin in the Navy said

651
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:37,997
that they've got this
big fat negotiation coming up,

652
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:40,665
and this war is gonna be over soon.

653
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,581
You know what I mean, right?

654
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:44,540
Just cut the crap.

655
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:46,040
What do you want?

656
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,872
Come on.

657
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,623
What are we doing here?

658
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,830
We should just drop the bomb and go home.

659
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:58,164
You know what I mean?
I don't wanna die here.

660
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,955
You know? Just tell me how many
flaks have they got down there, ok?

661
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:05,247
I mean... you saw them
clearly last time, right?

662
00:42:05,248 --> 00:42:06,790
- Right?
- Shut up.

663
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,081
The major battleground
is right there, in front of us.

664
00:42:11,706 --> 00:42:13,540
Without the bridge,

665
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,665
it's their hell.

666
00:42:15,873 --> 00:42:17,581
With it standing,

667
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,456
it's ours.

668
00:42:35,623 --> 00:42:37,081
What the...

669
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,331
Is that the bridge?

670
00:42:40,665 --> 00:42:43,748
Didn't you just bomb
this bridge 3 hours ago?

671
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:45,622
Jesus.

672
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:48,581
That bridge could
take our sappers three days easy.

673
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,498
I've had enough.

674
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:55,165
Why can't we blow this bridge up?

675
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:56,373
You know what?

676
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:57,998
They just won't die.

677
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:01,706
You need fire to burn them out.

678
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,664
Atc, this is warthog!

679
00:43:05,665 --> 00:43:09,165
Target bridge Alpha 4006 is resumed.

680
00:43:09,415 --> 00:43:11,873
Calling for m155 attack!

681
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:15,415
Repeat, calling for m155 attack!

682
00:43:16,998 --> 00:43:18,330
The recon plane is coming.

683
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:19,790
Take cover, now.

684
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,164
Felhunter, this is Smith.

685
00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:34,080
Target bridge Alpha 4006, coords

686
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:37,581
golf 5-3-0-8, target confirmed.

687
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:41,414
Fire support, m155 loading.

688
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:44,580
No.3 barrel loaded. Contact fuze.

689
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,415
Loaded. Fire!

690
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,040
Ejection.

691
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,165
Take cover. Howitzer.

692
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,080
Regiment, we're taking heavy fire.

693
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:03,247
Soldiers down, soldiers down.

694
00:44:03,248 --> 00:44:05,206
Do you copy?

695
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:10,498
That's a miss...

696
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,164
- Maybe you can...
- Listen to me.

697
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:16,706
Target bridge is missed by fifty yards
to the left. Two hundred yards over.

698
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,497
Reduce the radius. Rapid fire!

699
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:20,748
Copy.

700
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:24,248
1 mil to the right, 2 low! Fire!

701
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:36,873
The third angel sounded his trumpet,

702
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,956
and a great star, blazing like a torch,

703
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:53,415
Fell from the sky on a third of
the rivers and on the Springs of water...

704
00:44:56,331 --> 00:44:57,705
Good kill!

705
00:44:57,706 --> 00:44:59,205
Target bridge is down!

706
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:02,290
I repeat, this fucking bridge is down!

707
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:04,206
Felhunter, copy that.

708
00:45:04,331 --> 00:45:06,997
Atc, we are rtb now.

709
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:08,872

710

Copy.

711
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:26,580
Warthog, the track is ready.

712
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,164
And you're clear for landing.

713
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:29,915
Warthog, out.

714
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:36,915
Hey hill, Jesus. Where are you going!

715
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:44,497
Hill, hill, our mission's complete!

716
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:46,580
Smith, keep your altitude.

717
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:48,414
I gotta do some personal.

718
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,623
This is my leisure time.

719
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:55,123
Hill, we gotta go back!

720
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:21,623
Is that, is that gun shot?

721
00:46:21,873 --> 00:46:23,206
What are you doing?

722
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,081
Hill! Pull up! Pull up!

723
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,790
Come on.

724
00:47:09,623 --> 00:47:13,373
Mother of lord! Hill!
Your blood is spilling all over.

725
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,248
Are you dying? You are dying!

726
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:19,039
- Atc, atc! Warthog is down,
- shut the fuck up.

727
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,290
- I repeat, warthog is down!
- I'm still here.

728
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,873
Warthog, what's your status?

729
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:27,748
Please respond.

730
00:47:27,956 --> 00:47:30,665
Warthog, respond immediately.

731
00:47:47,415 --> 00:47:53,747
Coords golf 5-3-0-9,
calling for immediate attack!

732
00:47:53,748 --> 00:47:55,664
I repeat, there's a hidden flak.

733
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,415
There's a hidden flak.

734
00:47:57,581 --> 00:47:59,497

Incoming, enemy katyusha.
Break! Break! Break!

737
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,165
Sir.

738
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,664
It's our katyusha.

739
00:48:14,665 --> 00:48:15,956
Shut up.

740
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:23,248
Hold on.

741
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:25,040
What's that sound?

742
00:48:27,206 --> 00:48:29,956
Taking heavy!
Taking heavy! This is felhunter...

743
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:37,497
That's our artillery position!

744
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,498
There's hundreds of troops!

745
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,497
God damn it!

746
00:48:43,498 --> 00:48:46,122
How did they do it? This is unbelievable!

747
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,622
I don't wanna die here.

748
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:49,665
Let's get the hell outta here, man.

749
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:11,664
Hill, you took off without permission.

750
00:49:11,665 --> 00:49:13,747
Please return immediately.

751
00:49:13,748 --> 00:49:17,290
Otherwise you will
face prosecution by military court.

752
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,373
Give me that.

753
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,623

754
00:49:22,081 --> 00:49:26,205
Give my god damn plane

Who do you think
you are, you crazy little shit!

Do you hear me! Rtb immediately...

You wanna fight, yeah?

770
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,081
It's just you and me now.

771

Twelve o'clock.

772

You wanna hold this bridge?

774
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:58,165
You gotta pay for it!

I'm coming for you!

777
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:58,498
Nice trap. Well done, buddy.

778
00:55:14,373 --> 00:55:16,705
Delayed-action bombs' been activated.

779
00:55:16,706 --> 00:55:18,956
And the second aa gun is down.

780
00:55:20,706 --> 00:55:23,206
But the bridge will be fixed again.

781
00:55:23,748 --> 00:55:25,998
Bring out the big guys.

782
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,081
That's my cowboy!

783
00:55:29,331 --> 00:55:32,248
Smith is escorting
thunderbird to your position.

784
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,540
Good hunting gentleman.

785
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,790
That's a big guy.

786
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:10,498
Thunderbird, enemy anti-air
defense has been neutralized.

787
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:12,955
You're clear for low-altitude attack.

788
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,456
Thunderbird copy.

789

Roger that.

799
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:22,372
Smith, raise your altitude,
keep circling the position,

800
00:57:22,373 --> 00:57:24,331

801

Everyone, hurry up.

802
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,455
The bridge is about to be rejoined.

803
00:58:00,456 --> 00:58:01,540

01:00:49,456 --> 01:00:51,998
Height 2,800, distance 11,000.

849
01:00:52,373 --> 01:00:53,831
Out of range.

850
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,706
- Target locked on.
- Can't hit them out of range.

851
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,206
Target locked on.

852
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,581
Not enough height, I don't have a shot.

853
01:01:13,706 --> 01:01:16,248
Five degrees to the right.

854
01:01:19,623 --> 01:01:22,373
Lao guan, I only got 28 rounds left.

855
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,665
Target locked on.

856
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:28,915
I only got 28 rounds left.

857
01:01:31,915 --> 01:01:32,915
It's too fast.

858
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,040
I got him.

859
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:36,914
It's been hit.

860
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,581
Bravo.

861
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:41,872
- Next target.
- Yes, sir.

862
01:01:41,873 --> 01:01:43,872
Now this one is out of my reach.
I'm not gonna mess around.

863
01:01:43,873 --> 01:01:46,039
Lao guan, we don't have many rounds left.

864
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,581
Load, five degrees to the right.

865
01:01:47,706 --> 01:01:48,789
- Heizi, track it.
- Yes, sir.

866
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:49,915
Let go.

867
01:01:51,581 --> 01:01:52,456
Loadil

868
01:01:52,457 --> 01:01:54,123
lieutenant guan, it's him...

869
01:01:55,915 --> 01:01:57,122
Who do you listen to, me or him?

870
01:01:57,123 --> 01:01:58,998
You're not the company commander anymore.

871
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:03,665
There's no hitting that one.

872
01:02:06,748 --> 01:02:08,498
I'm just a private now,

873
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:10,456
but I'm still your fucking master.

874
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,665
Retract.

875
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,790
The bombers are too high

876
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,039
and the recon planes are too fast.

877
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,165
Five,

878
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,623
ten...

879
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:42,665
Anymore?

880
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:43,581
There're some in here.

881
01:02:43,582 --> 01:02:45,581
Eighteen rounds.

882
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,455
That's all we got.

883
01:02:50,456 --> 01:02:52,289
And ten thousand men are supposed to
cross the river before five in the morning.

884
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,455
How many times do you
reckon they'll come back?

885
01:02:53,456 --> 01:02:56,290
That's not your excuse for
using the canon like a sniper rifle.

886
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:00,165
Zhang fei.

887
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:03,539
Zhang fei, oh, zhang fei.

888
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,247
Why you're named after a legendary warrior

889
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,414
known to everyone in China.

890
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:09,622
I had no idea. What were
your parents thinking?

891
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:11,372
Why did they give you such a name?

892
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:12,497
Just look at you.

893
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:14,039
If this is your spot,

894
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,080
don't mention the plane,

895
01:03:15,081 --> 01:03:16,915
you can even hit a fly.

896
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:20,081
Don't hog the spot if
you're not gonna use it.

897
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:22,998
Go to the emplacement in the back.

898
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:30,497
The company commander assigned me here.

899
01:03:30,498 --> 01:03:31,915
And he assigned you that one.

900
01:03:32,123 --> 01:03:34,081
If I were still the company commander...

901
01:03:38,165 --> 01:03:39,790
Get out of my face

902
01:03:39,956 --> 01:03:41,373
and go to the back.

903
01:03:41,956 --> 01:03:43,790
There's a hundred rounds back there,

904
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,831
you should feel lucky.

905
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:50,331
Don't come over here unless I tell you to.

906
01:04:00,623 --> 01:04:03,122
It's not gonna be exposed during the day.

907
01:04:03,123 --> 01:04:04,622
You were demoted from
company commander to squad leader

908
01:04:04,623 --> 01:04:06,372
because of smoking.

909
01:04:06,373 --> 01:04:07,706
Yet you're still doing it.

910
01:04:09,956 --> 01:04:11,331
Fuck off.

911
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,540
Behold, the man shivers
before the kumgang bridge,

912
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:27,997
scratching his head

913
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,540
when he can hit no plane.

914
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:37,498
Oh, the man pees in his pants
before the kumgang river,

915
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:43,331
what a shame to someone named zhang fei.

916
01:05:43,748 --> 01:05:44,998
Sir.

917
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,873
At ease!

918
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:14,290
Count off.

919
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:17,205
1,2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7.

920
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,540
One missing.

921
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:24,748
What, am I not a person?

922
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,540
Sure you are.

923
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,706
40

924
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:37,665
Sir,

925
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:39,415
we only got 46 rounds left.

926
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,623
Goddamn Lao guan.

927
01:06:47,248 --> 01:06:48,581
Sir.

928
01:07:21,998 --> 01:07:23,331
Sir.

929
01:07:34,915 --> 01:07:36,455
Keep it moving.

930
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:37,706
Come on.

931
01:07:38,165 --> 01:07:39,580
Sir, examination complete.

932
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:40,914
We can cross whenever we're ready.

933
01:07:40,915 --> 01:07:43,789
Inform division, the bridge is fixed.

934
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,831
Prepare for crossing.

935
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:47,955
Hurry up!

936
01:07:47,956 --> 01:07:49,165
Assemble.

937
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:50,580
Assemble.

938
01:07:50,581 --> 01:07:52,497
Come on, 2nd platoon assemble.

939
01:07:52,498 --> 01:07:54,164
2nd and 3rd company assemble.

940
01:07:54,165 --> 01:07:55,705
Vacant the bridge,

941
01:07:55,706 --> 01:07:57,248
we're moving the vehicles.

942
01:07:57,456 --> 01:07:59,330
The crane will have to wait.

943
01:07:59,331 --> 01:08:00,830
Something's wrong with the wheels.

944
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:01,914
They're working on it.

945
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:03,373
Give us a minute.

946
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,581
Clean up the bridge, now.

947
01:08:11,998 --> 01:08:13,080
Maybe

948
01:08:13,081 --> 01:08:14,497
you should return to your emplacement

949
01:08:14,498 --> 01:08:16,123
and leave things be here.

950
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:19,331
It's getting dark and we're about to cross.

951
01:08:19,498 --> 01:08:20,998
Return to your emplacement.

952
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:25,206
We should stick to the plan.

953
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:27,831
The plan was

954
01:08:28,415 --> 01:08:30,831
you guard that gun back there well.

955
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:34,540
We only have two.

956
01:08:34,665 --> 01:08:36,425
And it's not like we
can fire them together.

957
01:08:36,706 --> 01:08:39,290
We don't want to show the enemy all we got.

958
01:08:40,373 --> 01:08:42,705
Whether our men can
make it across before five

959
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,331
and get to kumsong by six,

960
01:08:44,956 --> 01:08:46,716
so we'd have a shot
at winning the battle...

961
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,790
Second lieutenant zhang,

962
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,915
it's all up to you now.

963
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:05,956
What's your problem?

964
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:14,705
Should we switch
the emplacement to another spot?

965
01:09:14,706 --> 01:09:15,706
This location is compromised.

966
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:17,080
Nope.

967
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:18,997
We got pretty good
view and range from here.

968
01:09:18,998 --> 01:09:20,164
The higher the further.

969
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:21,081
Like peeing into the wind.

970
01:09:21,082 --> 01:09:22,414
Good view could mean danger.

971
01:09:22,415 --> 01:09:23,873
You're already a sitting duck.

972
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:28,581
Why don't you

973
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,915
give me ten rounds of your shells.

974
01:09:31,206 --> 01:09:32,956
Our of compassion, maybe?

975
01:09:35,748 --> 01:09:36,998
Sure.

976
01:09:50,206 --> 01:09:51,415
Fuck off.

977
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:11,372
I need more hands.

978
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,456
Get the crane out of here.

979
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:17,040
One, two, three.

980
01:10:17,248 --> 01:10:24,831
One, two, three.

981
01:11:12,873 --> 01:11:15,748
2nd and 3rd company cross in ten minutes.

982
01:11:16,373 --> 01:11:18,165
Speed up the crossing.

983
01:11:23,623 --> 01:11:25,039
On the double.

984
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,664
Three meters between each unit.

985
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:27,747
Do not squeeze.

986
01:11:27,748 --> 01:11:29,456
Cross in turn.

987
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,164
It's a recon plane.

988
01:11:36,165 --> 01:11:38,247
All units, take cover.

989
01:11:38,248 --> 01:11:40,706
Engineer company, get ready to take fire.

990
01:11:40,915 --> 01:11:42,289
Rear units fall back.

991
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:44,080
Advance units speed up the crossing.

992
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:46,164
Engineer company, take cover.

993
01:11:46,165 --> 01:11:47,665
Get down.

994
01:11:48,206 --> 01:11:50,498
Gunners take position.

995
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:55,373
Load it, two o'clock.

996
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:56,997
Loaded.

997
01:11:56,998 --> 01:11:58,914
Sir, this is a concealed emplacement.

998
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,247
We can't expose it.

999
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,831
Sergeant told us to conceal it.

1000
01:12:01,998 --> 01:12:03,498
For how much longer?

1001
01:12:24,581 --> 01:12:25,581
Evacuate now.

1002
01:12:25,582 --> 01:12:26,748
Take cover.

1003
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:36,872
Zhang fei.

1004
01:12:36,873 --> 01:12:38,373
The main force was hit.

1005
01:12:40,331 --> 01:12:41,665
Missed.

1006
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,040
They were aiming at the bridge.

1007
01:13:21,873 --> 01:13:23,372
Engineer company.

1008
01:13:23,373 --> 01:13:24,873
Fix the bridge.

1009
01:13:25,331 --> 01:13:26,456
Now.

1010
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:28,540
Someone go down and check the deck.

1011
01:13:29,915 --> 01:13:31,290
Put out the fire first.

1012
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:37,498
Fix the deck, now.

1013
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:37,330
Hurry up.

1014
01:14:37,331 --> 01:14:39,039
Our men are waiting to cross.

1015
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,205
Yes, sir.

1016
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:41,498
This way.

1017
01:14:52,248 --> 01:14:53,415
Smart-pants,

1018
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:54,747
where's zhang fei?

1019
01:14:54,748 --> 01:14:55,748
He's chilling up there.

1020
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:57,122
Tell him to ask guan

1021
01:14:57,123 --> 01:14:59,039
about the tobacco he promised me.

1022
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,122
Tobacco?

1023
01:15:00,123 --> 01:15:01,622
How's the bridge-fixing going?

1024
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:02,955
When can our boys cross it?

1025
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,622
Leave that to us.

1026
01:15:04,623 --> 01:15:07,040
You go shoot down one of 'em planes.

1027
01:15:10,123 --> 01:15:11,331
C'mon.

1028
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,206
How soon can they rejoin the bridge?

1029
01:15:22,373 --> 01:15:23,331
Sir,

1030
01:15:23,332 --> 01:15:25,747
didn't you say guan and
his squad were exposed?

1031
01:15:25,748 --> 01:15:26,997
Why aren't they taking any fire?

1032
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:28,290
Stop talking crazy.

1033
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:39,040
Something's wrong.

1034
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,206
Definitely not right.

1035
01:16:08,248 --> 01:16:10,165
Roger that.

1036
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:11,748
Take position.

01:16:12,831 --> 01:16:14,330

1039
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,955

Six o'clock.

1043
01:16:31,581 --> 01:16:33,248
Six o'clock.

1044
01:16:39,706 --> 01:16:41,165
Six o'clock.

1045
01:16:46,456 --> 01:16:48,956
Twelve o'clock.

1046
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:02,664
Load.

1047
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:04,373
Son of a bitch is coming right at us.

1048
01:17:04,748 --> 01:17:05,956
Loaded.

1049
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:12,080
Five degrees to the left.

1050
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:13,623
Sir, we are out of rounds.

1051
01:17:17,123 --> 01:17:18,289
Get your guns.

1052
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:19,873
Locking on target.

1053
01:17:31,665 --> 01:17:33,080
Sir, I got him.

1054
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,040
Saliva, take my place.

1055
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,290
Yes, sir.

1056
01:18:03,956 --> 01:18:05,914
It's our katyusha.

1057
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:08,873
Katyusha.

1058
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:36,290
Sir.

1059
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:39,331
The 1st squad has all settled down.

1060
01:20:39,456 --> 01:20:41,915
We are waiting for you
to Bury sergeant guan.

1061
01:20:49,248 --> 01:20:50,456
Sir.

1062
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,456
Sir.

1063
01:21:12,165 --> 01:21:13,497
Third squad,

1064
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:15,790
check the Cannon position.

1065
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,039
Check the Cannon position,

1066
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,455
see if they need any help.

1067
01:21:24,456 --> 01:21:26,206
- Move now.
- Yes, sir.

1068
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:28,248
No need.

1069
01:21:31,123 --> 01:21:33,205
We don't need any help.

1070
01:21:33,206 --> 01:21:35,040
Come down you guys.

1071
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,498
The bridge need to be reinforced, get down.

1072
01:21:38,456 --> 01:21:39,873
Zhang fei.

1073
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:45,123
I was looking for you.

1074
01:22:10,706 --> 01:22:11,956
Lao guan,

1075
01:22:13,623 --> 01:22:14,873
he's gone.

1076
01:22:30,706 --> 01:22:32,206
You guys buried him?

1077
01:23:06,706 --> 01:23:08,581
You're the last ones.

1078
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:18,123
Keep fixing the bridge.

1079
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:41,664
Sir, the bridge will be fixed in ten.

1080
01:23:41,665 --> 01:23:43,206
- Inform division.
- Yes, sir.

1081
01:23:44,206 --> 01:23:45,539
Watch your steps.

1082
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,039
- Nails everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

1083
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,706
Don't get your feet pierced.

1084
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:23,956
He's back.

1085
01:26:23,957 --> 01:26:25,205
It's him again.

1086
01:26:25,206 --> 01:26:26,165
How do you even know?

1087
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,497
I just know.

1088
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:28,665
Sir.

1089
01:26:33,248 --> 01:26:33,998
Sir.

1090
01:26:33,998 --> 01:26:34,831
This is bad.

1091
01:26:34,832 --> 01:26:36,415
The main force is crossing now.

1092
01:26:57,456 --> 01:26:58,955
How many rounds do we have left?

1093
01:26:58,956 --> 01:27:00,373
Forty-one.

1094
01:27:01,415 --> 01:27:02,998
Five tracers.

1095
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:04,623
Let's show him

1096
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:06,331
that we're here.

1097
01:27:06,706 --> 01:27:07,623
Gunners.

1098
01:27:07,624 --> 01:27:08,664
Take position.

1099
01:27:08,665 --> 01:27:09,581
Number four in position.

1100
01:27:09,582 --> 01:27:10,748
Number five in position.

1101
01:27:12,165 --> 01:27:13,498
Tracers.

1102
01:27:17,206 --> 01:27:18,581
Loaded.

1103
01:27:18,706 --> 01:27:19,873
Adjust.

1104
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,206
Load.

1105
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:49,373
Ammo loaded.

1106
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,081
Rear units keep up.

1107
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:20,790
Speed up the crossing.

1108
01:28:29,956 --> 01:28:31,581
Light it up.

1109
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,122
Light it.

1110
01:28:42,123 --> 01:28:43,456
Yes, sir.

1111
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,081
Lighted.

1112
01:29:00,748 --> 01:29:01,998
Lighted.

1113
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:09,497
- Lighted.
- Take position.

1114
01:29:09,498 --> 01:29:10,540
Yes, sir.

1115
01:29:13,331 --> 01:29:15,164
Sir.

1116
01:29:15,165 --> 01:29:16,831
It's like suicide.

1117
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:31,081
Two o'clock.

1118
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,790
Twelve o'clock.

1119
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,956
Get down.

1120
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:07,331
Keep at the motherfucker.

1121
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:10,748
Shoot him down.

1122
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:22,581
Load.

1123
01:30:22,582 --> 01:30:23,873
Yes, sir.

1124
01:30:24,373 --> 01:30:26,080
Don't you run.

1125
01:30:26,081 --> 01:30:27,914
Let's finish what we started.

1126
01:30:27,915 --> 01:30:29,956
Loaded.

1127
01:30:48,581 --> 01:30:49,622
Load.

1128
01:30:49,623 --> 01:30:50,831
Yes, sir.

1129
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,455
Six o'clock.

1130
01:30:55,456 --> 01:30:56,831
Yes, sir.

1131
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:04,331
Sir,

1132
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:05,664
I got no angle.

1133
01:31:05,665 --> 01:31:07,289
Wait till he's at three o'clock.

1134
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,623
Yes, sir.

1135
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,248
I am coming for you.

1136
01:31:23,498 --> 01:31:25,706
Come on.

1137
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,665
Come on.

1138
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,040
Come on.

1139
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:55,539
Rear units take cover.

1140
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,873
Advance units speed up the crossing.

1141
01:32:58,165 --> 01:32:59,914
Now.

1142
01:32:59,915 --> 01:33:01,330
Take cover.

1143
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:03,081
Do not expose.

1144
01:34:32,456 --> 01:34:34,540
Careful! Bombs in the water!

1145
01:34:35,373 --> 01:34:37,289
Bombs in the water! Be careful.

1146
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,955
Hurry. Go help.

1147
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:40,415
Hurry.

1148
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:07,581
The harbingers are here. Take cover.

1149
01:40:07,873 --> 01:40:10,123
The harbingers are here.

1150
01:40:10,998 --> 01:40:15,498
At the foot of changbanpo.

1151
01:40:16,165 --> 01:40:19,081
I came to the rescue of zhao yun

1152
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:24,081
and scared off

1153
01:40:24,373 --> 01:40:26,623
cao's army

1154
01:40:27,123 --> 01:40:30,290
of a million men

1155
01:40:33,706 --> 01:40:35,623
it is I,

1156
01:40:36,165 --> 01:40:37,998
zhang fei

1157
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:41,165
courtesy name

1158
01:40:41,706 --> 01:40:43,165
yide

1159
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,331
I shall go down in history

1160
01:40:48,873 --> 01:40:52,665
as one reckless man

1161
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:20,830
Atc. Warthog has been hit.

1162
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:22,831
Hill is kia.

1163
01:41:22,956 --> 01:41:26,664
Smith, raise your altitude,
keep circling the position,

1164
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:28,748
and await further instruction.

1165
01:41:49,998 --> 01:41:54,748
Guan, we got him.

1166
01:42:57,998 --> 01:42:59,790
Old Smith: Till this day.

1167
01:43:00,415 --> 01:43:03,873
I still smell the burning air.

1168
01:43:04,706 --> 01:43:06,290
Hill was lucky,

1169
01:43:06,748 --> 01:43:08,956
he went straight to hell.

1170
01:43:09,498 --> 01:43:10,956
But for me,

1171
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:13,081
I'm still living in it.

1172
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:17,498
And there's no home for me to go back to.

1173
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:24,497
The target has been completely destroyed.

1174
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:26,748
Requesting rtb now.

1175
01:44:29,331 --> 01:44:31,122
My eyes...

1176
01:44:31,123 --> 01:44:33,123
Got burnt bad.

1177
01:44:33,415 --> 01:44:35,206
And I could see nothing.

1178
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:39,290
To this day,

1179
01:44:39,581 --> 01:44:41,290
I can still remember

1180
01:44:41,831 --> 01:44:44,998
the smell of something burning.

1181
01:44:45,956 --> 01:44:50,248
All around me people were dying.

1182
01:45:00,123 --> 01:45:02,040
However, at that time,

1183
01:45:02,415 --> 01:45:04,540
believe it or not,

1184
01:45:05,415 --> 01:45:07,290
none of the boys

1185
01:45:07,581 --> 01:45:10,498
was afraid.

1186
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:21,331
Back in the day,

1187
01:45:21,873 --> 01:45:24,373
we were just a bunch of teenagers.

1188
01:45:26,831 --> 01:45:29,040
The only thing on our minds

1189
01:45:29,706 --> 01:45:32,123
was crossing that bridge

1190
01:45:32,706 --> 01:45:34,414
and fending off

1191
01:45:34,415 --> 01:45:35,998
the Americans.

1192
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:39,040
We all knew that

1193
01:45:39,873 --> 01:45:41,956
if we won this battle,

1194
01:45:42,581 --> 01:45:44,539
we would bring

1195
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,498
peace

1196
01:45:46,956 --> 01:45:48,206
to our people.

1197
01:47:24,456 --> 01:47:25,664
Smith,

1198
01:47:25,665 --> 01:47:30,081
there's still sign of activities
on bridge Alpha 4-0-0-6.

1199
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:33,289
The last bombing was just half an hour ago.

1200
01:47:33,290 --> 01:47:35,414
It's impossible to fix that bridge.

1201
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:37,705
Impossible is their weapon.

1202
01:47:37,706 --> 01:47:39,247
Go for a scout.

1203
01:47:39,248 --> 01:47:40,915
That's an order.

1204
01:47:40,998 --> 01:47:42,290
Yes, sir.

1205
01:47:51,081 --> 01:47:53,415
Atc, I'm in position.

1206
01:47:55,915 --> 01:47:57,081
What the...

1207
01:47:57,873 --> 01:47:59,248
There's the bridge.

1208
01:48:00,748 --> 01:48:03,790
Atc, requesting for bomber support.

1209
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:10,081
Roger that, support is on the way.

1210
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:32,373
One day,

1211
01:49:32,831 --> 01:49:35,831
I ran into this American veteran.

1212
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:39,123
And he still remembers

1213
01:49:39,415 --> 01:49:41,998
that bridge made of human flesh.

1214
01:49:43,206 --> 01:49:44,665
He said,

1215
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:47,956
I know you folks don't believe in god.

1216
01:49:48,498 --> 01:49:49,914
But what you did

1217
01:49:49,915 --> 01:49:52,373
was nothing short of a miracle.

1218
01:49:53,581 --> 01:49:56,915
It's just humanly impossible.

1219
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:59,331
And somehow

1220
01:49:59,498 --> 01:50:00,956
you guys pulled it off.

1221
01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:31,831
The army has crossed the bridge.

1222
01:50:32,248 --> 01:50:34,873
There is no point in attacking now.

1223
01:50:35,123 --> 01:50:37,873
There is nothing we can do to stop them.

1224
01:51:04,873 --> 01:51:07,164
Bomber squad is ready to attack.

1225
01:51:07,165 --> 01:51:09,206
Smith, keep your altitude.

1226
01:53:56,248 --> 01:53:58,373
For a new republic

1227
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,540
to earn its place

1228
01:54:00,748 --> 01:54:02,331
in the world,

1229
01:54:03,165 --> 01:54:05,623
and for our people

1230
01:54:05,790 --> 01:54:07,831
to have a better life,

1231
01:54:09,873 --> 01:54:12,956
soldiers had fought and died,

1232
01:54:13,165 --> 01:54:16,081
and they brought honor to the nation.

1233
01:54:25,831 --> 01:54:28,165
As is sung in our national anthem,

1234
01:54:28,873 --> 01:54:31,040
with our flesh,

1235
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:34,248
a new great wall was built.

1236
01:54:37,331 --> 01:54:39,164
Each and everyone of us

1237
01:54:39,165 --> 01:54:41,290
knew clearly then,

1238
01:54:42,915 --> 01:54:45,456
the happiness of future generations

1239
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,623
depended on us.

1240
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,873
And that's what kept us going.
